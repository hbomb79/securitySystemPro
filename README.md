This is the repository of the Security System on Minecraft using the Computer Craft mod version 1.63. In the program it is referred to as the hbombOS security suite mainly because it offers the ability to download any of my security program's also contained in the repository, this is to both provide a cool aspect to the game and give people the ability to use computercraft to their advantage.

Please refer to the Lisence for full Details on the terms of use for this program, but basically you may use it as you wish free of charge.

If you have any issues with any of the program's or have any ideas of other program's you would like to see in use on the installer page, then please tell me...
